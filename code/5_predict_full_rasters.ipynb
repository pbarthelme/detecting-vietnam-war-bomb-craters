    "### Model prediction across KH-9 images\n",
    "1) Applies the trained models to all KH-9 images across both study areas (raster files for each KH-9 image)\n",
    "2) Post-processing of model predictions, removing boundary class pixels and identifying individual crater instances (raster files for each KH-9 image)\n",
    "3) Extract individual crater polygons and centroids from post-processed raster files (geojson files for each KH-9 image)\n",
    "4) Create final set of crater polygons and centroids for each study area by removing craters that were counted twice due to overlapping KH-9 images (only relevant for tri-border area as Quang Tri images were mosaicked before) \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input:\n",
    "* *study_areas -> [study_area] -> rasters*: KH-9 images for each study area (geotiff files)\n",

    "* *pred_overlap*: Overlap of image tiles for the sliding window approach\n",
    "* *pred_batch_size*: Batch size used during model prediction\n",
    "* *pred_num_batches*: Number of batches to process together (each KH-9 image is processed in multiple batches due to their large size)\n",
    "* *pred_nodata*: Nodata value for created output rasters\n",
    "* *pred_dtype*: Data type of created output rasters\n",
    "* *postprocess_height*: Tile height used during post-processing step\n",
    "* *postprocess_width*: Tile width used during post-processing step\n",
    "* *postprocess_overlap*: Overlap of image tiles for the sliding window approach during post-processing\n",
    "* *min_crater_area*: Minimum area (in pixels) of a crater in the labelled image tiles (smaller craters are removed)\n",
    "* *n_classes*: Number of classes in the labelled image tiles = len(crater_ids) + 2 (boundary and background classes)\n",
    "* *boundary_id*: Integer that represents the boundary class in the labelled image tiles\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Outputs\n",
    "* *prediction_path*: model prediction for each KH-9 image (geotiff files)\n",
    "* *prediction_processed_path*: post-processed model predictions for each KH-9 image (geotiff files)\n",
